      <p>
        realgirl1994 is a series of zines that I began producing as part of the
        2020 residency at the Independent Publishing Resource Center in
        Portland, OR. These zines are adaptations of content from a private
        Tumblr blog of the same name. realgirl1994 functions as a virtual
        studio, a medium for me to publish my research notes and experiments in
        visual design.
